# Colourocity

Colourocity is a simple game created for my year 10 digital technologies assignment. The aim of the game is to complete each puzzle by collecting keys the same colour as your character to unlock the door. You can change your character's colour by touching the colour patches. Colours mix using the colour wheel, with white resetting colour state.
